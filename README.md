# Overview
 This Repo Was a demo for a Quorum Learning Lab on 05/16/18. We played around with GraphQL and built
 a small app that pulls a list of Github issues and supports pagination. The goal was to demonstrate Apollo Client and its integration with a React frontend.

 This demo was in part based on the wonderful tutorial [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-graphql-apollo-tutorial/#appendix-styling)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
